### **[2.11] - 2026-04-08**

v2 is not just a feature drop. The version number jumped because the architecture, ACL system, and multi-user logic required a ground-up rethink. Your existing setup, folders, and data are all forward-compatible.

**New in v2.11:**

-   **Virtual Collections (Exhibition Ready / Private):** group files from different physical folders into named albums without moving anything on disk. Mark a collection as Exhibition Ready to make it visible in the sharing portal. Private collections are invisible to guests and never appear in Exhibition.
-   **1-5 Star Ratings:** rate any image from 1 to 5 stars. Works for solo users too: a great way to personally curate your own library and surface your best work. Ratings are per-user, a global average is shown instantly in the grid, and you can sort by highest rated.
-   **Real-Time Comments:** leave notes on any image, whether you work alone or with a team. Solo users can annotate their own files as personal memos. With a team, each message has its own visibility: Public (everyone), Internal (staff only), or Direct Message to a specific user. Comment keywords are fully searchable from the Filters panel. Press `G` on any image to open the details panel.
-   **Color-Coded Status Tags:** tag any image with a pipeline state using keys `1` to `5`: Approved (green), Review (yellow), To Edit (blue), Rejected (red), Select (purple). Browse all files carrying a given status across every folder at once from the Status tab in the sidebar.
-   **Full User Management with ACL Roles:** create accounts and assign roles: Admin, MANAGER, STAFF, FRIEND, USER, CUSTOMER, GUEST. Each role controls which interface they can access, what they can see, and what they can download.
-   **Exhibition Mode (fully optional):** a separate, read-only portal you can launch when you want to share work with clients, collaborators, or friends. Completely optional: if you have no need to share, simply never launch it. Only the collections you mark as Exhibition Ready are visible. Workflows and prompts are always hidden from guests.
-   **Clean Export (`Shift+W`):** download any file stripped of all embedded workflows, prompts and EXIF metadata. Safe to send to anyone without exposing your process.  
-   **Wiki Website:** Full documentation with screenshots at [smartgallerydam.com](https://smartgallerydam.com) (accessible from the top menu: **"Docs"**).  

** Improved **  
-   **Mount Any External Drive or Folder:** mount external drives, NAS volumes or network paths directly from the UI. Mix ComfyUI output folders with photo archives, video collections or any other media library. All DAM features work on everything, workflow extraction only applies where there is a workflow to extract.  
-   **Powerful search operators:** filter by multiple keywords at once using AND, OR and exclusion operators across prompts, models, LoRAs, comment text and more.
-   **Model Manager workflow:** CivitAI lookup is now selection-driven with explicit checkboxes and visible progress feedback during fetches.
-   **Workflow-aware filters:** added dedicated `Model`, `LoRA`, and `Ratings` filters in the advanced filter panel.
-   **Smart workflow asset dropdowns:** model and LoRA filters now use dropdowns populated from detected workflow references instead of relying only on free-text guessing.
-   **Negative filename search:** the filename search now supports exclusion syntax such as `!term`, `NOT term`, and `!= term`.

#### **[1.55] - 2026-02-05**

**Added**  
- **Video Storyboard & Analysis - ffmpeg required**
*   **Quick Storyboard ('E'):** Hover over any video in the grid and press `E` to instantly open the storyboard.
*   **Grid Overview:** Instantly analyze video content with a clean **11-frame Grid** covering the entire duration from Start to the **True Last Frame**.  
- **Thumbnail Grid Size:** Added a new toggle in the Options menu (`⚙️`) allowing users to switch between **Normal** and **Compact** view on desktop. This preference is saved automatically.  
- **Options Menu & Autoplay Toggle:** New persistent **`⚙️ Options`** menu (Desktop/Mobile) to manage core gallery settings.
- **Video Autoplay Control:** Introduced a session-based toggle to explicitly enable/disable video autoplay in the grid. (Default: **OFF** to save bandwidth).
- **'P' Shortcut:** Added the **`P`** key shortcut to quickly toggle the Video Autoplay setting.
- **Dynamic UX for Videos:**
    - On **Desktop**, when Autoplay is OFF, a small **▶ icon** appears in the corner. Clicking it plays the video **in-grid** for quick preview.
    - On **Mobile**, the thumbnail is fully clickable to open the Lightbox (Click-to-Open).
- **Visual Feedback:** Added a full-screen loader (`loader-overlay`) to prevent interaction during the necessary page reload after changing the Autoplay setting.
- **Focus Mode:** A new streamlined view for professionals. Hides UI clutter and changes click behavior to "Select Only" for rapid batching. Accessible via the **`⚡`** button or **`Q`** key.
- **Shortcuts Button:** Added a dedicated `? Shortcuts` button in the desktop header.
- **Platform Detection:** The Shortcuts panel now automatically displays `⌘` symbols for Mac users and `Ctrl` for Windows/Linux.
- **Generation Dashboard:** Added a high-fidelity summary panel at the top of the Node Summary to show Seed, Model, Steps, and Prompts at a glance.
- **Grid View Shortcuts:** Enabled `N` (Node Summary) and other action keys directly in Grid View via mouse hover.
- **Smart Move (`M`):** The Move shortcut now detects context: if no files are selected, it automatically selects the hovered item and opens the dialog.
- **Real Path Resolution:** New "Folder Info" tool that resolves and displays the physical path on disk (useful for Docker volumes and Symlinks).
- **Asynchronous Rescan:** Re-engineered the "Rescan Folder" feature to run in a background thread to avoid 502/Timeout errors on massive libraries.

**Changed**
- **Unified Shortcut Logic:** Completely rewrote input handling. **Mouse Hover** now strictly takes priority over **Keyboard Focus** for all actions. This fixes inconsistencies where shortcuts would target the wrong file after closing the Lightbox.
- **Help UI Overhaul:** Redesigned the Keyboard Shortcuts (`?`) overlay into a clean, responsive layout.
- **Hybrid Parser:** Integrated `ComfyMetadataParser` to support both API-format and UI-format JSON metadata simultaneously for better accuracy.
- **Header Layout:** Reorganized the top bar to group tools (`Shortcuts`, `Focus Mode`, `AI Manager`) on the right side for better desktop usability.
- **Smart Dialog Accessibility & Interaction Overhaul** Enhanced Keyboard Navigation


**Fixed**
- **KSampler Data Alignment:** Fixed a critical parsing issue in Node Summary where the missing `control_after_generate` field caused values (Steps, CFG, Sampler) to shift and display incorrectly.
- **Focus Loss Bug:** Fixed an issue where the `V` key became unresponsive after returning to the grid until the mouse was moved.
- **Resolution Display:** Fixed an issue where linked resolutions appeared as node IDs (e.g., "41,0") instead of actual dimensions.


## [1.54] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- **Compare Mode:** Implemented a split-view comparison engine for Images and Videos.
  - **Sync Engine:** Mathematical synchronization of Zoom (`scale`) and Pan (`translate`) coordinates between two viewports.
  - **Diff Algorithm:** Backend endpoint (`/api/compare_files`) that parses workflow JSONs, flattens nodes, and returns a sorted table of parameter differences.
  - **UX Tools:** Added image rotation (90° steps) for vertical layouts and interactive floating labels to toggle between filename and resolution.
- **Link External Folders:** Added capability to mount arbitrary filesystem paths (e.g., external drives, network shares) into the gallery root. Includes a recursive directory browser API (`/api/browse_filesystem`).
- **Mount Guard:** Implemented a startup safety check that verifies the accessibility of linked mount roots. If a drive is offline, the system prevents the database garbage collector from deleting associated metadata (Favorites, AI Data).
- **Quick Actions (Grid View):**  
  - **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Added `T` hotkey to instantly show/hide the Search & Filter overlay panel.
  - **Quick Delete:** Added `DEL`/`CANC` listener. Hovering over an item and pressing the key executes deletion immediately, bypassing the confirmation modal for rapid culling.
  - **Quick Favorite:** Added `F` listener. Hovering over an image and pressing `F` toggles the favorite status instantly with visual feedback.
- **Enhanced Lightbox Metadata:** 
  - **Megapixel Calculation:** Frontend now dynamically calculates and displays the MP count (e.g., `16.7 MP`) based on image dimensions, essential for verifying upscales.
  - **Path Resolution:** Clicking the folder name now resolves symlinks/junctions to display the *Real Disk Path* alongside the internal gallery path.
- **DB Migration:** Added automatic schema verification for the `size` column during initialization to ensure compatibility with legacy databases.

### Changed
- **Performance (Smart Grid):** Completely rewrote the `IntersectionObserver` logic for video elements. Videos now strictly execute `.pause()` when leaving the viewport and `.play()` when entering, resolving high resource usage in large grids.
- **Mounting Logic (Windows):** Refactored the `mount_folder` endpoint to handle Windows specifics robustly. It now attempts a Junction (`mklink /J`) first, and automatically falls back to a Symbolic Link (`mklink /D`) if the target is a Virtual Drive (VXHD) or Network Share, capturing specific `stderr` messages for debugging.
- **Consistency:** The application now enforces a **Full Sync** on every startup (removing the check for empty DB) to guarantee that files deleted or renamed externally via the OS are correctly purged from the internal database.
- **Scanning Logic:** Switched file indexing from a Blacklist approach to a strict **Whitelist** of valid media extensions. This prevents the scanner from attempting to process temporary files (e.g., `_output_images_will_be_put_here`) or partial downloads.

### Fixed
- **Mounting Errors:** Fixed generic "returned non-zero exit status 1" errors during folder linking by sanitizing path separators before passing them to the Windows shell.
- **Video Playback:** Fixed race conditions in the lazy loading logic to ensure the video poster/thumbnail is always visible while the video buffer is loading.

## [1.53] - 2026-01-07

### Added

#### Automation & Refresh
- **"Auto-Watch" Folder Mode**: A configurable background monitoring system. Users can set a custom interval (via the refresh menu options) to automatically check for and display new files without manual reloads.

#### Search & Filtering
- **Recursive Search Mode**: New "Include Subfolders" toggle enables deep searching through all nested directories from the current location.
- **Smart Filter Persistence**: Active search filters and sorting preferences are preserved when navigating between folders.
- **Dynamic Filter Discovery**: Dropdowns for file extensions and filename prefixes now update dynamically via AJAX based on the content of subfolders.

#### Video & Workflow Support
- **ProRes Video Support**: Native-like preview for ProRes `.mov` files directly in the browser via real-time ffmpeg transcoding (no intermediate files required).
- **Workflow Shortcut**: Press `C` to instantly copy the current image's workflow metadata to the clipboard.

#### Gallery & UI Enhancements
- **Modernized Design System**: Unified "Glass/Dark" theme using CSS variables and backdrop-filters, offering improved contrast and reduced visual noise.
- **Seamless Infinite Scrolling**: Images now load dynamically as you scroll, eliminating the need for "Load More" buttons and optimizing memory usage on both desktop and mobile.
- **Enhanced Notification System**: Improved state persistence to ensure feedback messages remain visible across page reloads.
- **Collapsible Sidebar**: The folder sidebar can now be resized or completely collapsed to maximize the gallery workspace.
- **Lightbox Immersive Mode (Hide Toolbar)**: New toggle button (shortcut `H`) to hide the overlay toolbar, allowing for a distraction-free, full-screen viewing experience.
- **Lightbox Help Overlay**: Added a "Help" toggle that displays text labels for all toolbar icons, significantly improving accessibility on touch devices where hover tooltips are unavailable.
- **Improved Mobile-First Architecture**: Fully responsive layout with an independently scrollable sidebar and adaptive thumbnail grid for mobile devices.
- **Asynchronous Modal System**: Replaced blocking native browser alerts with non-blocking "Smart Dialogs" using Promises (async/await) for a smoother user experience.

### Fixed
- Improved stability during image/video loading when complex filters are active.
- Fixed sidebar scrolling issues and layout glitches in deeply nested folder structures.

### Changed
- General UI/UX optimizations for performance, responsiveness, and visual consistency across all devices.

## [1.51] - 2025-12-17

### Added

#### Search & Filtering
### Added
- **Prompt Keywords Search**: New filter to search for text strings directly within the generation prompt. Supports comma-separated multiple keywords (e.g., "woman, kimono").
- **Deep Workflow Search**: Added a new `Workflow Files` search field. This searches specifically within the metadata of the generated files to find references to models, LoRAs, and input images used in the workflow (e.g., search for "sd_xl").
- **Global Search**: Users can now toggle between searching the "Current Folder" or performing a "Global" search across the entire library.
- **Date Range Filters**: Added `From` and `To` date pickers to filter files by their creation/modification time.
- **"No Workflow" Filter**: A new checkbox option to quickly identify files that do not contain embedded workflow metadata.
- **Redesigned Filter Panel**: The search and filter options have been moved to a collapsible overlay panel for a cleaner UI on both desktop and mobile.

#### Backend & Database
- **Database Migration (v26)**: Added `workflow_files` column to the database.
- **Metadata Backfilling**: On first startup after update, the system automatically scans existing files to populate the new `workflow_files` search data for deep searching.
- **Optimized SQL**: Improved query performance for filtered searches using `WAL` journal mode and optimized synchronous settings.

### Fixed
- **Filter Dropdown Performance**: Added a limit (`MAX_PREFIX_DROPDOWN_ITEMS`) to the Prefix dropdown to prevent UI freezing in folders with thousands of unique prefixes.
- **Navigation Logic**: Fixed state retention issues when switching between global search results and folder navigation.

## [1.41.1] - 2025-12-05

### Fixed
- **Image Size**: Fixed an issue where the image size for thumbnail generation.
- **Docker**: Added `FORCE_CHOWN` environment variable to force chown of the BASE_SMARTGALLERY_PATH folder only. Pre-checked permissions for the BASE_SMARTGALLERY_PATH to avoid permission errors.

## [1.41] - 2025-11-24

### Added

#### Core & Configuration
- **Batch Zip Download**: Users can now select multiple files and download them as a single `.zip` archive. The generation happens in the background to prevent timeouts, with a notification appearing when the download is ready.
- **Environment Variable Support**: All major configuration settings (`BASE_OUTPUT_PATH`, `SERVER_PORT`, etc.) can now be set via OS environment variables, making deployment and containerization easier.
- **Startup Diagnostics (GUI)**: Added graphical popup alerts on startup to immediately warn users about critical errors (e.g., invalid Output Path) or missing optional dependencies (FFmpeg) without needing to check the console.
- **Automatic Update Check**: The application now checks the GitHub repository upon launch and notifies the console if a newer version of `smartgallery.py` is available.
- **Safe Deletion (`DELETE_TO`)**: Introduced a new `DELETE_TO` environment variable. If set, deleting a file moves it to the specified path (e.g., `/tmp` or a Trash folder) instead of permanently removing it. This is ideal for Unix systems with auto-cleanup policies for temporary files.

#### Gallery & File Management
- **Workflow Input Visualization**: The Node Summary tool now intelligently detects input media (Images, Videos, Audio) used in the workflow (referenced in nodes like `Load Image`, `LoadAudio`, `VHS_LoadVideo`, etc.) located in the `BASE_INPUT_PATH`.
- **Source Media Gallery**: Added a dedicated "Source Media" section at the top of the Node Summary overlay. It displays previews for all detected inputs in a responsive grid layout.
- **Audio Input Support**: Added a native audio player within the Node Summary to listen to audio files used as workflow inputs.
- **Advanced Folder Rescan**: Added a "Rescan" button with a modal dialog allowing users to choose between scanning "All Files" or only "Recent Files" (files checked > 1 hour ago). This utilizes a new `last_scanned` database column for optimization.
- **Range Selection**: Added a "Range" button (`↔️`) to the selection bar. When exactly two files are selected, this button appears and allows selecting all files between them.
- **Enhanced Node Summary**: The workflow parser has been updated to support both ComfyUI "UI format" and "API format" JSONs, ensuring node summaries work for a wider range of generated files.
- **Smart File Counter**: Added a dynamic badge in the toolbar that displays the count of currently visible files. If filters are active (or viewing a subset), it explicitly shows the total number of files in the folder (e.g., "10 Files (50 Total)").

#### User Interface & Lightbox
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Help**: Added a help overlay (accessible via the `?` key) listing all available keyboard shortcuts for navigation and file management.
- **Visual Shortcut Bar**: Added a floating shortcuts bar inside the Lightbox view to guide users on available controls (Zoom, Pan, Rename, etc.).
- **Advanced Lightbox Navigation**: 
    - Added **Numpad Panning**: Use Numpad keys (1-9) to pan around zoomed images.
    - Added **Pan Step Cycling**: Press `.` to change the speed/distance of keyboard panning.
    - Added **Smart Loader**: New visual loader for high-res images in the lightbox for a smoother experience.

#### Docker & Deployment
- **Containerization Support**: Added full Docker support to run SmartGallery in an isolated environment.
- **Docker Compose & Makefile**: Included `compose.yaml` for easy deployment and a `Makefile` for advanced build management.
- **Permission Handling**: Implemented `WANTED_UID` and `WANTED_GID` environment variables to ensure the container can correctly read/write files on the host system without permission errors.

### Fixed
- **Security Patch**: Implemented robust checks to prevent potential path traversal vulnerabilities.
- **FFprobe in Multiprocessing**: Fixed an issue where the path to `ffprobe` was not correctly passed to worker processes during parallel scanning on some systems.

## [1.31] - 2025-10-27

### Performance
- **Massive Performance Boost with Parallel Processing**: Thumbnail generation and metadata analysis have been completely parallelized for both the initial database build and on-demand folder syncing. This drastically reduces waiting times (from many minutes to mere seconds or a few minutes, depending on hardware) by leveraging all available CPU cores.
- **Configurable CPU Usage**: A new `MAX_PARALLEL_WORKERS` setting has been added to allow users to specify the number of parallel processes to use. Set to `None` for maximum speed (using all cores) or to a specific number to limit CPU usage.

### Added
- **File Renaming from Lightbox**: Users can now rename files directly from the lightbox view using a new pencil icon in the toolbar. The new name is immediately reflected in the gallery view and all associated links without requiring a page reload. Includes validation to prevent conflicts with existing files.
- **Persistent Folder Sort**: Folder sort preferences (by name or date) are now saved to the browser's `localStorage`. The chosen sort order now persists across page reloads and navigation to other folders.
- **Console Progress Bar for Initial Scan**: During the initial database build (the offline process), a detailed progress bar (`tqdm`) is now displayed in the console. It provides real-time feedback on completion percentage, processing speed, and estimated time remaining.

### Fixed
- **Critical 'Out of Memory' Error**: Fixed a critical 'out of memory' error that occurred during the initial scan of tens of thousands of files. The issue was resolved by implementing batch processing (`BATCH_SIZE`) for database writes.

### Changed
- **Code Refactoring**: File processing logic was centralized into a `process_single_file` worker function to improve code maintainability and support parallel execution.

## [1.30] - 2025-10-26

### Added

#### Folder Navigation & Management (`index.html`)
- **Expandable Sidebar**: Added an "Expand" button (`↔️`) to widen the folder sidebar, making long folder names fully visible. On mobile, this opens a full-screen overlay for maximum readability.
- **Real-time Folder Search**: Implemented a search bar above the folder tree to filter folders by name instantly.
- **Bi-directional Folder Sorting**: Added buttons to sort the folder tree by Name (A-Z / Z-A) or Modification Date (Newest / Oldest). The current sort order is indicated by an arrow (↑↓).
- **Enhanced "Move File" Panel**: All new folder navigation features (Search, and Bi-directional Sorting) have been fully integrated into the "Move File" dialog for a consistent experience.

#### Gallery View (`index.html`)
- **Bi-directional Thumbnail Sorting**: Added sort buttons for "Date" and "Name" to the main gallery view. Each button toggles between ascending and descending order on click, indicated by an arrow.

#### Lightbox Experience (`index.html`)
- **Zoom with Mouse Wheel**: Implemented zooming in and out of images in the lightbox using the mouse scroll wheel.
- **Persistent Zoom Level**: The current zoom level is now maintained when navigating to the next or previous image, or after deleting an item.
- **Zoom Percentage Display**: The current zoom level is now displayed next to the filename in the lightbox title (e.g., `my_image.png (120%)`).
- **Delete Functionality**: Added a delete button (`🗑️`) to the lightbox toolbar and enabled the `Delete` key on the keyboard for quick deletion (no confirmation required with the key).

#### System & Feedback (`smartgallery.py` & `index.html`)
- **Real-time Sync Feedback**: Implemented a non-blocking, real-time folder synchronization process using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- **Sync Progress Overlay**: When new or modified files are detected, a progress overlay is now displayed, showing the status and a progress bar of the indexing and thumbnailing operation. The check is silent if no changes are found.

### Changed

#### `smartgallery.py`
- **Dynamic Workflow Filename**: When downloading a workflow, the file is now named after the original image (e.g., `my_image.png` -> `my_image.json`) instead of a generic `workflow.json`.
- **Folder Metadata**: The backend now retrieves the modification time for each folder to enable sorting by date.


## [1.22] - 2025-10-08

### Changed

#### index.html
- Minor aesthetic improvements

#### smartgallery.py
- Implemented intelligent file management for moving files between folders
- Added automatic file renaming when destination file already exists
- Files are now renamed with progressive numbers (e.g., `myfile.png` → `myfile(1).png`, `myfile(2).png`, etc.)

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where file move operations would fail when a file with the same name already existed in the destination folder
- Files are now successfully moved with the new name instead of failing the operation
